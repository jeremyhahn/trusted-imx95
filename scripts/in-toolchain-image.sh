# Run a command in the toolchain image against a COPY of the checkout.
#
#   usage: scripts/in-toolchain-image.sh <image> <command...>
#   e.g.   scripts/in-toolchain-image.sh go-enclave-toolchain:abc make build
#
# in-toolchain-template: v5 (ci-template v1.34.1; v4 was v1.29.4). Ships beside ci.yml; copy it to
# scripts/ with the workflow. From go-quicraft's scripts/in-toolchain-image.sh
# (a141c3c), with the container prefix and uid taken from the environment.
#
# How CI runs a stage in the devcontainer image (handbook ci-standard.md §2). A
# CI runner reaches its Docker daemon through a socket, so a bind mount would
# resolve on the daemon's host, where the checkout does not exist. This
# creates the container, streams the checkout into it (`.git` included: the
# releasability tests read it) owned by the image's non-root user, then starts
# it and returns the command's exit status. It works the same against a local
# daemon; on a workstation `make docker-run CMD=...` (bind mount) is the
# shorter path.
#
# The container keeps the integration service's posture where a copy-in allows
# it: every capability dropped, no-new-privileges, the same ulimits and pid
# bound, a non-root user, no network. The root filesystem is writable only
# because `docker cp` cannot write into a read-only one.
#
# IN_IMAGE_NETWORK=bridge gives the container a network, for the stages that
# must reach one: `make deps-check` asks the module proxy for the newest
# releases, and `make security` fetches the vulnerability databases. Only then
# are GOPROXY reopened, a writable module cache mounted (below; /tmp/gomodcache
# with CI_CACHE=off), and GOPRIVATE passed through by name. The forge
# credentials the runner injects (GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0 and
# GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0, dependency-resolution.md §6) are never passed in: the
# container runs a pull request's own scripts with a network, and this
# repository has no private modules to fetch. Nor is any *TOKEN* variable;
# test/ci_scripts_test.sh holds both.
#
# v2 (ci-template v1.22, Company Agent m616 item 2): the caches live in named
# volumes on the daemon's host (ci-standard.md §6), never in the container's
# writable layer or its 3 GB /tmp: GOCACHE at /cache/gobuild and
# GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE at /cache/golangci for every stage, and, for a bridge
# stage, GOMODCACHE at /cache/gomod (a no-network stage keeps the image's own
# read-only module cache, so it still proves the image works offline). The
# volumes are <CI_STACK_PREFIX>cache-<class>-{gobuild,golangci,gomod}, one set
# per repo, trust class and daemon host, kept across jobs. CI_CACHE_CLASS
# (default pr) is `main` only for a push to main, so a pull request never
# writes a cache that main's build reads. A new volume's root is given to
# IN_IMAGE_UID by a helper container holding CHOWN and nothing else.
# scripts/trim-ci-caches.sh bounds their size. CI_CACHE=off mounts none (v1).
#
# v3 (ci-template v1.22.2, Company Agent m641 item 2 and m646 item 3): the
# stage runs in this sibling container, so the sibling holds the job slot's
# CPU bound. The job container's cgroup cpu.max gives it (rounded up; nproc
# when the job has no quota; IN_IMAGE_CPUS overrides), and the sibling gets
# --cpus N with GOMAXPROCS=N and GOFLAGS=-p=N. golangci-lint's default
# concurrency follows the container CPU quota, so lint takes N with no flag.
# A 4-CPU slot on the Dells gives 4; never a hardcoded number.
#
# v4 (ci-template v1.29.4, Company Agent ruling 261(c); claude-agents #379
# comment 157032):
# - The sibling holds the job slot's memory bound the same way (go-qrdb, from
#   dept-infra #1337; go-trusted-platform #1182). The job container's cgroup
#   memory.max (8g when the job has no limit; IN_IMAGE_MEMORY, a size such as
#   12g, overrides) becomes --memory, and --memory-swap is set to the same
#   size, so the stage gets no swap: a stage that outgrows it is OOM-killed and
#   fails, instead of swapping the shared runner host. A 16g job slot gives 16g.
# - Go's build and link scratch is on disk, not the 3 GB /tmp tmpfs (go-xkms
#   #1733, 6d40166): `make coverage` links cgo test binaries in $WORK and filled
#   /tmp (ENOSPC "final link failed") in 8 go-xkms Devcontainer jobs on
#   2026-10-26. An anonymous volume on the image's /var/tmp (IN_IMAGE_SCRATCH
#   overrides the path) is TMPDIR and GOTMPDIR; it is on the daemon's data disk,
#   and cleanup's `docker rm -v` removes it. A scratch directory the image
#   lacks, or the run's user cannot write, fails the stage by name.
# - A bridge stage's GOPROXY puts DEVCACHE_GOPROXY (Athens, devops.md §2a)
#   first when the runner sets it: <DEVCACHE_GOPROXY>|https://proxy.golang.org,
#   so a miss or an unreachable cache falls through to the public proxy.
#   GOPRIVATE travels with it, so a private path never reaches either proxy.
#   Unset, the chain is https://proxy.golang.org. There is no `direct` entry
#   (v5, dependency-resolution.md, "No direct fetch, anywhere"); a private
#   path is fetched by GOPRIVATE/GONOPROXY, never through GOPROXY.

# trusted-imx95 (2026-11-12, Codex security P1 on #19): pull request jobs
# share the runners' Docker daemon and can move any tag. A trusted run
# (GITHUB_EVENT_NAME set and not pull_request or pull_request_target)
# therefore takes <image> only as an image ID, sha256:<64 hex>, the one
# `make -s toolchain-ref` prints, and refuses a tag before any container
# starts. test/ci_scripts_test.sh holds this.
#
# The container is named <CI_STACK_PREFIX>tc-<pid>-<random>, under the prefix
# scripts/reap-stale-ci-stacks.sh reaps (default <checkout dir>-ci-, which in CI
# is <repo>-ci-), and is removed on every exit. IN_IMAGE_UID is the non-root
# uid the command runs as (default 10001; devcontainer.md §5: any non-root uid).
